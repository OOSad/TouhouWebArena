# Engine Change Proposal: Godot vs. Unity

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the rationale for switching the project's game engine from Godot to Unity. While Godot is a capable engine, recent development cycles have revealed inefficiencies related to implementing core gameplay mechanics. A switch to Unity is proposed to leverage a more extensive knowledge base, improve development velocity, and establish a more efficient collaborative workflow, while fully adhering to the project's core requirements.

## 2. Analysis of Current Challenges in Godot

The primary challenges encountered during the initial development phase in Godot include:

*   **Implementation Hurdles:** Significant time was spent troubleshooting fundamental features such as UI overlays (debug info), character instantiation, and basic projectile systems.
*   **Knowledge Base Limitations:** The AI agent's effectiveness is directly correlated to the volume and quality of its training data. Godot, while growing, has a smaller public corpus of documentation, tutorials, and code examples compared to Unity. This results in more "from-scratch" problem-solving, increasing development time and the likelihood of errors.
*   **Workflow Inefficiencies:** The current workflow requires the AI agent to manage both scene creation/manipulation and scripting. This monolithic approach creates a single point of failure and does not optimally leverage the strengths of both the human and AI developer.

## 3. Adherence to Core Project Requirements

The decision to switch engines is made with the two primary project requirements held as paramount. Unity is fully capable of meeting these needs.

*   **Requirement 1: The project must run on a web browser.**
    *   **Unity Solution:** Unity has robust, mature support for building to **WebGL**. This allows the compiled project to run natively in modern web browsers, which is a standard and well-documented deployment path.

*   **Requirement 2: The project must be able to run multiple matches at the same time.**
    *   **Unity Solution:** This requirement is primarily architectural. The existing plan to use a separate Node.js server to manage matchmaking and game state remains the same. The Unity client will connect to this server via WebSockets. Furthermore, Unity can be run in a **headless mode** on a server, which allows for running multiple instances of the game logic for server-side validation or simulation without rendering, directly supporting the need for concurrent matches.

## 4. Proposed Solution: Switching to Unity

A migration to Unity addresses the development challenges while satisfying the core requirements:

*   **Vast Knowledge Base:** Unity's extensive documentation and C# code examples will significantly enhance the AI agent's ability to generate correct and reliable code.
*   **Optimized Collaborative Workflow:** The proposed workflow in Unity establishes a clear separation of concerns:
    *   **Human Developer:** Manages the Unity Editor (scenes, GameObjects, components).
    *   **AI Agent:** Focuses exclusively on writing C# scripts.
*   **Industry Standard:** Unity's widespread adoption provides a wealth of resources and pre-built assets.

## 5. Next Steps

1.  **Formalize Project Structure:** Define the standard folder and scene structure for the new Unity project.
2.  **Migrate Core Logic:** Plan the translation of existing GDScript concepts (Player, Shot, Object Pooling) into C# components.
3.  **Implementation:** Begin creating the new Unity project and implementing the core gameplay loop.

By making this pivot now, we can establish a more productive and sustainable development foundation.
